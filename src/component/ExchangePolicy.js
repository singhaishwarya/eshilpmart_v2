                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>As a Customer, if you’re considering a product return, please note the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> All hand-woven and hand-crafted products on the portal are produced by weavers and artisans in villages mostly at their homes.</li>
                  <li>Unevenness in weaves, prints, minor slubs in fabric and slight variation in color are expected outcome of an authentic craft process. These variations are typical characteristics of any hand-crafted product and are not to be considered as damage or defective.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Return Policy</h4>
                <p>We accepts returns only if a wrong product or damaged product is delivered. The product needs to be in unused and unsoiled condition with price tag intact.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Note: Within 10 days of receipt of the product which is being returned (7 days in case of Handcraft Jewellery), please email to support team with supporting photos of the product mentioning the reason for return.</li>

                  <li>Go to My Account&gt;Addresses to remove outdated address. • Most of the seller’s partnered courier service providers make more than one attempt to deliver a package.</li>
                  <li>If nobody is available to accept the delivery after multiple attempts, the package is returned to the seller. If a package is damaged on its way to the Customer, the courier service provider will return it to the seller without attempting delivery. In rare cases, it is also possible that the address label was difficult to decipher during the shipping and handling process, or that the courier service left the package at a different address than what was printed on the label.</li>
                </ul>
